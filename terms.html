    <p>As we continue to expand our user-facing policies and terms to provide you with more information on the services and products available to you, we intend to periodically update our policies to provide greater transparency and understanding. Please note: This Health.IQ Platform Terms of Use for Registered Users is the registered user's agreement between Health.IQ and the registered user for Health.IQ services and products.</p>

    <p>Health.IQ Limited ("Health.IQ," "our," "us," or "we" ) offers a digital health navigation solution accessible at https://hlthiq.com and its associated sites at Google Play and the App Store, and via its mobile application, collectively referred to as the "Health.IQ Platform." The Health.IQ Platform provides health and wellness services only to users who register, log-in, and use the Health.IQ platform (i.e., Registered Users as defined in the Health.IQ Platform Privacy Policy).</p>

    <p>This Terms of Use is an agreement between Health.IQ ("us", "we" or "our") and registered users of the Health.IQ Platform ("you" or "user"). BY CLICKING ON "I AGREE" AND USING THE HEALTH.IQ PLATFORM, YOU AFFIRMATIVELY ACCEPT THESE TERMS OF USE. Additionally, when agreeing to this Terms of Use, you must also agree to the Health.IQ Platform Privacy Policy, as these terms expressly reference incorporations of the Health.IQ Platform Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>In general, as long as you comply with the most current version of our Terms of Use as a registered user and are at least eighteen (18) years of age, Health.IQ grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, limited privilege to use the Health.IQ Platform, subject to any terms or usage restrictions by a third-party such as a wireless provider.</p>

    <p>The Health.IQ Platform Terms of Use consists of the following sections:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Section 1 – Uses, Limitations, and Restrictions</li>
      <li>Section 2 – Partnerships with Third Parties To Provide Services</li>

    <p><strong>Uses of the Health.IQ Platform</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>A. Supplemental Tool:</strong> In consideration of your use of the Health.IQ Platform, your use is intended to supplement, and is not intended to substitute the expertise and judgment of your healthcare professional, unless such healthcare professional (i.e., your licensed healthcare provider, such as, but not limited to practicing Registered Dietitians, Personal Trainers, Medical Doctors, Nurse Practitioners, Physician Assistants, Mental Health Counseling, or any other healthcare professional) also provides advice within the Health.IQ Platform. We use machine learning and artificial intelligence to help create personalized experiences that aim to proactively identify user needs and engage you with recommendations as a tool to support your overall health picture, goals, and needs. We encourage you to exercise independent judgment before applying any information provided through the Health.IQ Platform to your own needs. As such, Health.IQ cannot guarantee that the information provided to you, unless when provided by a qualified health professional (e.g., correspondence with your provider within the Health.IQ Platform), is always accurate or applicable to your particular circumstance, therefore reliance on information provided through the Health.IQ Platform is voluntary and solely at your own risk.</p>

    <p><strong>B. Educational Resources:</strong> The Health.IQ Platform may make available self-care informational services which provide general medical, wellness and other health-related information. These communications and resources are not comprehensive medical texts and do not include all the potential information regarding a subject matter. These communications and resources are for general educational and informational purposes only and should not be relied upon as a substitute for patient-specific medical diagnosis and treatment or construed, directly or indirectly, as the practice of medicine or dispensing of medical services by Health.IQ. Such information is not a substitute for seeing a healthcare professional for medical treatment.</p>

    <p><strong>C. Accurate Information:</strong> In order to create personalized experiences, Health.IQ relies on information we receive from you and other sources. However, if information is incorrect or not up to date, this may limit our effectiveness. When using our Platform and inputting your personal information, ideas, and/or beliefs you agree that you will: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the input fields and/or forms; and (b) maintain and update this information to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If during the use of any portions of the Health.IQ Platform, you knowingly provide untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete information, Health.IQ has the right to terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Health.IQ Platform.</p>

    <p><strong>D. Mandatory Reporting:</strong> While we encourage you to share accurate information as such details may be shared amongst our staff for the purpose of providing services to you, we may also share details of communication we receive to: aid in mandatory reporting of abuse or neglect; prevent or reduce a serious threat to another's health or safety; or to report other reportable events, as required and defined by state and local law.</p>

    <p><strong>E. Changes To Our Platform:</strong> You acknowledge that while we make every effort to keep you updated on important changes to our Platform, the Health.IQ Platform may be changed or updated at any time for any reason without direct notice to you and information may not always be up to date. Health.IQ may also make changes in, or discontinue products, services or programs offered at any time, without liability to you and with or without notice. We reserve the right to remove, screen, edit, or reinstate content, including third party and user created content (e.g. comments or reviews), from time to time at our sole discretion and without notice to you. For example, we may remove a user review or comment if we believe it violates our guidelines. We have no obligation to retain content nor do we guarantee any confidentiality with respect to user created content.</p>

    <p><strong>F. Account Activation and Security:</strong> As a registered user of the Health.IQ Platform, you may receive an activation code for registration to set up user account or access our Platform. You hereby agree that you will: (i) not distribute your activation code (if applicable); (ii) keep your password protected and not share it with others; and (iii) promptly inform us at info@hlthiq.com if you feel that your account is not secure.</p>

Not Professional Advice:</strong> With the exception of healthcare advice offered by qualified individuals (e.g., correspondence between you and a healthcare professional within the Health.IQ Platform), we do not offer the Health.IQ Platform with the intention of providing health related legal, medical, healthcare coverage, tax, financial, or any other professional advice. Moreover, Health.IQ is not an agent of third party services unless indicated in this Terms of Use. Certain Services offered within the Health.IQ Platform are general in nature and are intended to be for informational purposes and not intended, and should not be used, to replace professional advice. Your personal situation is unique, and any information and advice obtained through the Health.IQ Platform may not be appropriate for your individual circumstance. Accordingly, before making any final decisions or implementing any health care or wellness strategy, you should consider obtaining additional information and advice from your healthcare provider or others who are fully aware of your individual circumstance.</p>

    <p><strong>Limits to Clinical Care Guides</strong> - The Health.IQ Platform may offer support services by use of our Clinical Care Guides, who are also licensed clinicians who can support you by educating on medications and/or coaching you to the next step in your care journey, however Clinical Care Guides are not healthcare providers, do not provide telemedicine service, and do not practice medicine. For example, a Clinical Care Guide will not have the ability to prescribe medications, make a diagnosis, or recommend a treatment.</p>

    <p><strong>Limits to Non-Clinical Care Guides</strong> - You may also interact with a Non-Clinical Care Guide (i.e., a non-licensed clinician), who may answer other related questions, however they will not offer clinical information, and may route any clinical-related questions to a Clinical Care Guide.</p>

    <p><strong>Limits to Certified Health Advisors</strong> - You may interact with certified health advisors who act as supportive partners on your health journey to help you identify wellness areas of interest. Health advisors do not provide medical advice, nor do they replace services such as those provided by a healthcare professional as defined in this Terms of Use (e.g., Registered Dietitians, Personal Trainers, Medical Doctors, Nurse Practitioners, Mental Health Counseling, or any other health professional). We encourage you to consult with a licensed provider before making changes to your diet, exercise routine, or other medically related items. Your advisor may access your medical record, or may collaborate / share information with your healthcare team as consented by you.</p>

    <p><strong>B. Submitting A User Review:</strong> Should you choose to submit a user review, you agree that: (a) you will not submit any personal information, including protected health information ("PHI") that may be used to identify you or any other individual; (b) your user review will be accurate and does not violate these Terms of Use, including the restrictions described in the "Restrictions within the Health.IQ Platform" section below; (c) you may control and are responsible for the content of your user review and assume all risks associated therewith, including anyone's reliance on its quality, accuracy, or reliability; and (d) Health.IQ retains the absolute right and sole discretion to publish, post, display, remove, or screen your review without notice to you.</p>

    <p><strong>C. User Reviews of Services:</strong> Reviews of healthcare service providers by our advisors are considered informational only and are not intended to - and do not - constitute professional advice with respect to the information provided. User reviews are based on personal experiences of users that may not be complete, comprehensive, representative of, or applicable to your individual circumstances. Please consult your healthcare provider or other relevant professional regarding your specific situation.</p>
